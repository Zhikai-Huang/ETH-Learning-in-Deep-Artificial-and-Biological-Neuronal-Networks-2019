Question: Observe the performance of the current implementation (i.e. in terms of correctly
classified images) and discuss what the reason is for obtaining these poor results.
As a hint, you can plot the distributions of the weights before and after training
using the command line argument --plot_weight_hist.


Answer: --- **Remark** - Answer should be less than 200 words. ---

In the plot, we see that the dispersion of the trained compared to the initial weights is different. The trained weights
show a higher variance.
