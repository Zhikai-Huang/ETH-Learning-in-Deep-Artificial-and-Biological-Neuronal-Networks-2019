Question: Discuss the biological and non-biological aspects of the spiking neural network and the
training scheme implemented in this exercise.

You may wish to refer to Neftci et al. (2019)[2] or Zenke et al. (2017)[3] for inspiration.

You could think about:
 ● Neuron model
 ● Spiking function
 ● Architecture
 ● Task: classification, supervision
 ● Backpropagation
 ● How biology might implement it, if it can
 ● Links to previous lectures

Answer: --- **Remark** - Answer should be less than 200 words. ---
