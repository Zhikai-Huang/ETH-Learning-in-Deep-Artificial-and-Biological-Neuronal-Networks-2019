The attractiveness of spiking neural networks lies in its similiarity to biological neural networks. It is known that a large proportion of biological neural networks make use of some kind of spiking neurons. Our model is of course a highly simplified version of biological neurons. Training methods using backpropagation don't seem biologically possible, as it is not local, requires bi-directional information transfer (biological neurons are uni-directional), and for other reasons. Also, biological neural networks can learn in an unsupervised manner, whereas our models use a supervised approach. The fact that our spiking model has a timing component is definitely an improvement comparing it to classical neural networks from the perspective of biological plausibility. Brain neurons are highly efficient from a power consumption perspective, and are very fault tolerant. Our mathematical models based on gradients and numerical losses are (a) not power efficient, at least not a CPU-based implementation, and (b) are highly sensitive to numerical precision.
